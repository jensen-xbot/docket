# Docket

Simple, fast iPhone app for managing your daily tasks without the noise.

## Description

Docket replaces scattered notes and mental load with organized, actionable lists. Built for busy professionals who need quick capture and clear organization without friction.

## Why This Exists

This is a learning project — a training ground for building full-stack iOS apps before tackling Closelo Mobile. Focus is on:
- Mastering SwiftUI
- Understanding SwiftData
- Integrating Supabase for cloud sync
- Shipping a complete, polished app

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** SwiftUI (iOS 17+)
- **Database:** SwiftData (MVP) → Supabase (v1.0)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (v1.0)
- **Platform:** iOS (iPhone)

## Design Inspiration

- Apple Reminders (simplicity)

- Clear (gesture-based, RIP)

## Roadmap

### MVP (Now)
- Create, edit, complete, delete tasks
- Local persistence
- Clean native iOS UI

### v1.0 (Next)
- Cloud sync across devices
- Due dates & notifications
- Categories & priorities
- Recurring tasks

## Getting Started

Requirements:
- Xcode 16+
- iOS 17+ device or simulator
- Apple Developer account (for device testing)

Coming soon: Setup instructions once we initialize the Xcode project.

## Budget
