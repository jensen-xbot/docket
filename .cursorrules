# Project: Docket

## Overview
Simple, fast iPhone app for managing your daily tasks without the noise.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: SwiftUI
- Backend: Supabase (v1.0)
- Database: SwiftData (MVP) → PostgreSQL (v1.0)

## Architecture Patterns
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for SwiftUI
- Repository pattern for data layer abstraction
- SwiftData for local persistence
- Supabase client for remote sync (v1.0)

## Conventions
- **Naming:** Swift style — PascalCase types, camelCase variables/functions
- **File structure:** Feature-based grouping (Tasks/, Auth/, Common/)
- **State management:** @Observable ViewModels, injected as environment objects

## Key Files (Coming Soon)
- `DocketApp.swift` — App entry point
- `Task.swift` — Data model
- `TaskListView.swift` — Main task list
- `TaskDetailView.swift` — Create/edit task

## Context
This app is for Jon — a busy professional juggling sales work, side projects (Closelo), family, and personal routines. Needs quick capture (2-3 taps) and clear organization without friction.

## Development Notes
- iOS 17+ target (latest SwiftUI features)
- Dark mode from day 1 (SwiftUI handles this)
- Focus on MVP first — local persistence only
- v1.0 adds cloud sync via Supabase
