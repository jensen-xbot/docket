# TODO: Docket

## Phase: Setup
- [x] Create project repository
- [ ] Initialize Xcode project (SwiftUI, iOS 17+)
- [ ] Set up project folder structure
- [ ] Configure gitignore for Xcode
- [ ] Set up Apple Developer account
- [ ] Deploy initial scaffold to GitHub

## Phase: Core (MVP)
- [ ] Create Task model (SwiftData)
- [ ] Build task list view
- [ ] Build create task view
- [ ] Build edit task view
- [ ] Implement complete/incomplete toggle
- [ ] Implement delete task
- [ ] Add local persistence (SwiftData)
- [ ] Basic UI polish (dark mode, animations)
- [ ] Test on physical device

## Phase: Polish (v1.0)
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Implement Supabase Auth
- [ ] Add cloud sync (Supabase real-time)
- [ ] Add due dates
- [ ] Add categories/tags
- [ ] Add priority levels
- [ ] Implement push notifications
- [ ] Data migration from local to cloud
- [ ] Add analytics (PostHog/Sentry)

## Phase: Launch
- [ ] App Store submission prep
- [ ] Screenshots and app preview
- [ ] App description and keywords
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] Submit to App Store
- [ ] Monitor for crashes/feedback

## Blocked / Research
- [ ] Learn SwiftData basics
- [ ] Learn SwiftUI navigation patterns
- [ ] Research Supabase Swift SDK

## Timeline
- **Target:** Soft target — learning project, quality over speed
- **Week 1 Goal:** Working MVP with local persistence
- **Risks:**
  - Xcode/SwiftData version compatibility
  - Apple Developer account activation delays
  - Learning curve on SwiftUI

## Notes
- Focus on MVP first — resist v1.0 features until core works perfectly
- Test early on real device (simulator doesn't catch all issues)
- Document learnings as we go for future iOS projects
